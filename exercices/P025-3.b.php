Calculate the time of passage of Mars through the perihelion in May 1992, and the value of its radius vector at that instant

The following values for the distance Sun-Mars have been calculated at intervals of four days :

1992 May 12.0 TD  1.381 4294
1992 May 16.0 TD  1.381 2213
1992 May 20.0 TD  1.381 2453

The differences are

    a = $a
                                c = $c
    b = $b
    
Extreme value formulas :

    ym = y2 - ((a + b)Â² / 8 * c)
    
    nm = -1 * ((a + b) / (2 * c))
    
from which we decuce :

    ym = $ym    and nm = $nm

Hence, the least distance from Mars to Sun is $ym AU.
The corresponding time is found by multiplying 4 days (the tabular interval) by +$nm;
This gives $ct, or $day day and $hour hours later than the central time, that is 1992 May $exday, at {$hour}h TD.
