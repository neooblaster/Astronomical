Calculate tan(A), where A = 9h14m55.8s

We first convert A to hours and decimals

    9h14m55.8s = 9 + 14/60 + 55.8/3600 = $onhour
    
Then, multiplying by 15 (Cause 1 hour = 15Â°deg)

    A = $timedeg
    
Dividing this value by 180/pi = $rad
A in radian = $timedeg / $rad = $alpharad;
We then find tan(A) = $tanalpha
P0081a;
