# Astronomical Exercise 3.b, Page 025

## Context : 

    f(x) = (......)
    
    x is the time we want to find where...
 ...y is the second value we want to find
     
     
## Exercise :

Calculate the time of passage of Mars through the perihelion in May 1992, and the value of its radius vector at that instant

The following values for the distance Sun-Mars have been calculated at intervals of four days :

    1992 May 12.0 TD  1.381 4294
    1992 May 16.0 TD  1.381 2213
    1992 May 20.0 TD  1.381 2453

The differences are

    a = -0.00020810000000004
                                c = 0.00023210000000007
    b = 2.4000000000024E-5
    
Extreme value formula :

    ym = y2 - ((a + b)Â² / 8 * c)
    
Corresponding value of the argument x formula : 
    
    nm = -1 * ((a + b) / (2 * c))
    
from which we decuce :

    ym = 1.3812030466555    and nm = 0.39659629470049

Hence, the least distance from Mars to Sun is `1.3812030466555` AU.

The corresponding time is found by multiplying `4` days (the tabular interval) by `+0.39659629470049`;

This gives `1.5863851788019`, or 1 day and 14 hours later than the central time, that is 1992 May 17, at 14h TD.
